# Hackathon-Spa-R-tans

For the time being, this will be use as a daily diary for the comp.

We will be using R and Rshiny to build and deploy our dashboard. **May the best teams win** ðŸ˜¤. 


# Day 1 (Start Day)
---
Jaz- Created sample dashboard template with Rshiny App, Determined method of extracting components of date using lubridate to enable filtering of year, hour and day, created possible visualizations addressing tasks 1 and 2 for single data file, created visualizations incorporating University Brand Colors.  

Mowgli - Wrote code that would read file names from data directory and combine all data into one data frame (3.6 million observations). This file was too large to push to github, so the file produced was ignored. The forloop still useful for "furture" / incoming data. Script also parses building name from file name, by removing *_results.csv* from file name

### Next step:                                                                          STATUS
- Parse useful information from dates                                         (complete for single file)
- Begin Visualisation                                                         (complete for single file)
- Begin building shiny to house visualizations                                          (started)
- Find a place to store "combined_results" ?
- Ask about external source data usage
- Customize Fonts to align with University Brand
- Apply single file visualization to combined File Visualizations
- Organize Story to be of interest to students, staff, and community
- Generalize/parametrize code to accept updated files
- Discuss/Revise Appropriate enhanced visualizations
- Add detail to graphs, determine appropriate tables, and boxes to add
- DEBUG color issue with second geom_col chart
