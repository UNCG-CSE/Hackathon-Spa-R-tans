# Hackathon-Spa-R-tans

For the time being, this will be use as a daily diary for the comp.

We will be using R and Rshiny to build and deploy our dashboard. **May the best teams win** ðŸ˜¤.

Mowgli - Wrote code that would read file names from data directory and combine all data into one data frame (3.6 million observations). This file was too large to push to github, so the file produced was ignored. The forloop still useful for "furture" / incoming data. Script also parses building name from file name, by removing *_results.csv* from file name

### Next step:
- Parse useful information from dates
- Begin Visualisation 
- Begin building shiny to house visualizations
- Find a place to store "combined_results" ?
